# Hangman

According to Wikipedia, a hangman game is a guessing game for two or more players. 
One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by 
suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Originally a Paper-and-pencil game, 
there are now electronic versions. 

For this project, I want to improve my programming and problem-solving abilities. 
I am using this beginner project to improve my planning processes by trying various methods
and approaches to solve the problem.

# Planning Process

For this project, the computer will be randomly selecting a word from a list of words. 
The player has **7 chances** to guess the correct word.

## Game Rules
*  Start with 7 chances to win.
*  Guess an alphabet.
*  Chances stay the same or reduce. If you guess correctly or not.
*  Guess the entire word before your chances run out to win.

## Possible Project Constraints
*  Randomize a word, from a downloaded word dictionary.
    * Read the file.
    * Make a list of words.
    * Random select a word.

*  Play the game.
    * Guess an alphabet. If correct chances stay the same, or chances reduce.
    * End game if chances < 7.
